### Bomb diffuser game made for Zybo Zynq-7000 Developement Board

 - First level bomb can be defused by inputing the binary code  that you got  from torturing the terorists using the switches.
 - Second level bomb defusing presums that you have a good reaction in order to catch the leds in all 4 positions using the swithes.
 - And last level (hard core mode) makes you think in binary. You need to make the leds show a specific combination  but in order to get to it you need to figure what each button does (hint: each of them switcha specific led or leds to the oposite position). Of course you can press randomly and pray to God that you somehow guess the order of button. Button better is to think as a programmer and apply your logic of binary operation of course after understanding what each button does.

 You have limited amount of time for each task, you need to complete them all in order to finish the game. HAVE FUN and MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.
